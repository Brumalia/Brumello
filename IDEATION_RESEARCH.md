# App Ideation Research & Exploration

## Context Update (Feb 14, 2026)

**Solo but not alone:**
- Matty: Side project builder (builds Brumello, experiments)
- Workmate: Also building AI agent, "vibe coding" together
- Potential collaboration opportunity?

**Key Questions:**
- Is workmate interested in partnering?
- Different skills/interests?
- Time commitment both can give?
- Would make some products viable that wouldn't solo

## Product Ideas Revisited (With Co-Founder Context)

### If You're Truly Solo
- **Best fit:** Spending AI (8-10 weeks, solo-friendly, clear revenue)
- **Risky:** Agent Studio (requires deep product thinking + 3-4 months)
- **Possible:** Brumello AI (extends existing product)

### If You Partner with Workmate
- **Best fit:** Agent Studio (split: you do frontend, they do orchestration?)
- **Possible:** Agent Marketplace (need both building + discovering)
- **Ambitious:** Agent Studio → Marketplace pipeline (2-person team dream)

## Two-Person Team Dynamics

### What Changes
✅ Can ship 2x faster (parallel work)
✅ Can tackle bigger projects
✅ Built-in feedback/brainstorming
✅ Shared responsibility = less burnout
✅ Easier to hire/fundraise with 2 co-founders

❌ Need clear roles/responsibilities
❌ Decision-making gets harder
❌ Revenue split/equity needs clarity
❌ Timezone/schedule coordination

## Questions About Workmate

1. **What are they building?** (AI agent for what?)
2. **Do they want to partner or just code nearby?**
3. **Skills:** Frontend/Backend/AI/Product?
4. **Time:** Weekend project? Could go full-time?
5. **Philosophy:** Same vibe coding energy?
6. **Revenue expectations:** Do they care about money?

## Scenarios to Explore

### Scenario A: Stay Solo
- Pick Spending AI (9-week project)
- Build it with Brumello + OpenClaw knowledge
- Launch, get feedback
- Then either scale or do next product

### Scenario B: Casual Collaboration
- Workmate helps with specific areas (e.g., you build UI, they do backend)
- Share revenue but no formal partnership
- Low commitment, high flexibility

### Scenario C: Formal Co-Founder
- Split Agent Studio 50/50
- Proper equity agreement
- Weekly syncs, shared roadmap
- Aim for real business together

### Scenario D: Company Building
- Both go full-time eventually
- Start as side project
- Aim for $10k MRR, then decision point
- Could raise funding later

---

## How to Start That Conversation

**Low-pressure questions:**
- "What are you building? Sounds cool!"
- "Would you be interested in collaborating on something bigger?"
- "Ever thought about building a product together?"
- "Want to grab coffee and brainstorm?"

**Don't need to:**
- Ask about equity/money yet
- Commit to anything
- Overthink it

## Vibes-Based Product Picking

**"Vibe coding" suggests:**
- Both prefer building over planning
- Fast iteration, real-time feedback
- Probably not super serious (yet?)
- But could become serious fast

**Products that fit this:**
1. **Agent Studio** (build → ship → iterate)
2. **Marketplace** (keep adding features)
3. **Spending AI** (chat-based, fast iteration)

**Products that don't:**
- ❌ Bootcamp (needs planning/teaching)
- ❌ Template library (boring setup)

## Session Tomorrow: Addition

When you're back, can you tell me:
1. Who's your workmate?
2. What are they building?
3. Would they be interested in hearing about these ideas?
4. What's their strongest skill?

Then we can map a strategy that fits your actual situation (solo vs team).
