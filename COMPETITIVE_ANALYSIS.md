## Known Competitive Landscape

### **Strengths to Emulate**
- ✅ HuggingFace: Community + model discovery
- ✅ Vercel: Frictionless deployment
- ✅ n8n: Visual workflow builder UX
- ✅ Notion: AI feels like a natural feature
- ✅ LangChain: Open-source mindshare

### **Gaps We Could Fill**
- ❌ Most low-code builders are for "workflows", not "agents"
- ❌ No simple agent marketplace (just model hubs)
- ❌ AI in task management is superficial (not core to UX)
- ❌ Conversational finance still early/experimental
- ❌ High learning curve for custom agents

### **Our Advantages**
- ✅ Deep AI/orchestration knowledge
- ✅ Fast iteration (proven with Brumello)
- ✅ Can focus on ease-of-use vs features
- ✅ Can build integrations fast (Vercel/Supabase skills)
- ✅ Open-source credibility
